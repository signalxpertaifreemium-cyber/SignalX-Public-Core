# SignalX Transparency Statement

SignalX is currently in Private Beta. We open-source the Feature Contract and
Logic Documentation for community audit and reproducibility, while keeping the
core Execution Engine proprietary to mitigate front-running risks by
institutional bots and adversarial actors.

This balanced approach is intended to support scientific scrutiny without
exposing execution pathways that could be exploited to degrade performance or
harm users.
